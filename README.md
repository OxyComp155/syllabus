Notes from the first day of class


**Note: This syllabus is based largely on the 2012 COMP 155: Webmaking course, taught by Daniel Chamberlain and Wendy Hsu. Credit goes to Dr. Hsu for developing much of the material for that syllabus, a large part of which is present in the 2013 version of the course.
